This work-in-progress project is a Ray Tracer (computer graphics) developed by me (Didier Mu√±oz) for my Master Thesis in Computer Science.

Basically consists of a simple pipeline where:
-Scenes descriptions are loaded.
-Acceleration structures are constructed (or will be).
-Rays are traced.
-Colors are calculated.
-And the resulting image is stored.

Currently acceleration structures are non-existent, but it is the next step in the development.

All the code presented was written in C++11, and the sole library required is:
-FreeImage
